**Todo:**

* ~~Make it look prettier~~ Not prettier but functional I spose
* ~~Add ability to upload images~~ ~~Done for Blazor, not for elm~~ Done for both
* ~~Websocket support for individual threads~~ Completed in elm, may be possible in blazor with js interop or possible using a c# client but that seems annoying
